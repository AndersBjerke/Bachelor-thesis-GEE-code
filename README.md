**Bachelor Thesis - Avalanche Analysis Using Sentinel-1 and Google Earth Engine**

**Project Overview**
This repository contains the code developed for the Bachelor thesis titled "Further Understanding of Avalanche Cycles Using Remote Sensing". 
The project focuses on quantitative analysis of avalanche incidents that occurred on March 31, 2023, in Northern Norway, utilizing data from Sentinel-1 satellites and processed through Google Earth Engine (GEE).

**Objectives**
The main goal of this project is to apply remote sensing technology to improve understanding and prediction of avalanche cycles in Northern Norway.
The codebase specifically demonstrates how to:
Filter and process Sentinel-1 imagery in Google Earth Engine.
Perform change detection analysis to identify avalanche activity.
Visualize the results for easy interpretation and analysis.

**Repository Structure**
VH ASCENDING: Contains scripts for processing VH polarization data in ascending orbit.
README.md: This file, providing project information and guidance.

**Technologies Used**
Google Earth Engine (GEE): Used for accessing and processing Sentinel-1 satellite imagery.
JavaScript: The scripting language used for coding in GEE.
Setup and Usage

**To use the scripts:**
Ensure you have access to Google Earth Engine.
Clone this repository to your local machine or directly into the GEE Code Editor.
Open the scripts in the GEE Code Editor.
Adjust the geometry variable to specify your area of interest (AOI).
Run the scripts to process the data and visualize the results.
